# Survey
freeCodeCamp Survey Form Project

Start Notes:
This project is from freeCodeCamp's second responsive web design project to re-create a survey form (https://codePen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP)
my project can be found at https://codepen.io/llamalamp/full/XWbXMXE. 

A lot like my first attempt at the tribute page project, I had a lot of trouble getting everything to line up the first time. I am more
confident now that I can do it now that I have a better understanding of how the different parts of css work together. 

I also had a HUGE problem with the background. The image is overlaid with a opacity color which in turn has another container with
another opacity layer. I could not get those layers to work correctly. The first one kept changing my white text to a blue hue. I only
fixed it because i basically copy/pasted the css in different places until it looked right. This time, I intend to be a lot more purposful
with the actions and code that I use.
